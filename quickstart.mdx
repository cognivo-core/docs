### Step 1: Get your API credentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Obtain your Bearer token">
    To access the Quantum API, you'll need a valid Bearer token. Contact your system administrator or access your Quantum dashboard to obtain your authentication token.
    
    <Warning>
    Keep your Bearer token secure and never share it publicly.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Upload your first document

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Prepare your document">
    Choose a document you want to upload to the Quantum AI Agent. Supported formats include:
    - PDF files
    - Images (JPEG, PNG)
    - Text files
    - Office documents (Word, Excel)
    
    <Note>Make sure your document is ready and accessible on your system.</Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="code" title="Make your first API call">
    Use the Documents API to upload your first document:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://www.cognivo.app/api/v1/documents/create" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "owner_id": 1,
        "company_id": 2,
        "agent_id": 5,
        "documents": [
          {
            "name": "my-document.pdf",
            "mimetype": "application/pdf",
            "base64": "JVBERi0xLjQK..."
          }

    "created_documents": [
      {
        "id": 123,
